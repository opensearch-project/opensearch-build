## Component Onboarding

This document describes steps to onboard a new plugin to release workflow for continuous integration and testing.

### Onboard to OpenSearch Meta

#### opensearch-build

Add the new plugin to the [opensearch-build meta](meta/README.md) is used to create issues across components included in a distribution, e.g. [opensearch-build#819](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/pull/819), which added [cross-cluster-replication](https://github.com/opensearch-project/cross-cluster-replication).

```bash
$ cd meta
$ meta project import plugin git@github.com:opensearch-project/plugin.git
```

#### opensearch-plugins

Add the new plugin to the [opensearch-plugins meta](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-plugins/blob/main/META.md), e.g. [opensearch-plugins#97](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-plugins/pull/97), which added [cross-cluster-replication](https://github.com/opensearch-project/cross-cluster-replication).


### Onboard to Build Workflow

1. Update a [manifest](/manifests) for a particular release to include your plugin.  For example to be included in the 1.1.0 release, you would update [opensearch-1.1.0.yml](/manifests/1.1.0/opensearch-1.1.0.yml). We require your plugin name, repository url, and git ref that should be used. For unreleased versions this should be a branch in your repository.  Once a release is cut, these refs will be updated to build from a tag or specific commit hash.

2. Create a `scripts/build.sh` if you have specific requirements that are not covered by the [default build.sh script](/scripts/default/build.sh) and commit it to your repository.

3. Ensure your `build.sh` reads and passes along both `-Dbuild.snapshot=` and `-Dopensearch.version=` flags.  Snapshot builds should produce a -SNAPSHOT tagged artifact for example `opensearch-plugin-1.1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.zip` where a release build of the same component would produce `opensearch-plugin-1.1.0.0.zip`.

4. Execute `./build.sh` to ensure your component builds and all artifacts are correctly placed into ./artifacts/ with correct output names.

5. Execute `./assemble.sh` to ensure the full bundle is assembled and placed in to /bundles/*.tar.gz.  Unpack the tarball to ensure all your components are placed in their correct locations.

6. Publish a PR to this repo including the updated manifest and the names of the artifacts being added.

### Onboard to `test-workflow`

1. Update the test configuration file (use 1.3.0 as an example), [opensearch-1.3.0-test.yml](manifests/1.3.0/opensearch-1.3.0-test.yml), for a particular release, to include your plugin. This test configuration defines full suite of tests - `integ`, `bwc`, that can be run on the plugin.

2. For integration testing, the `test-workflow` runs integration tests available in the plugin repository. You will need to add `integ-test` config for your plugin in opensearch-1.3.0-test.yml, [example](manifests/1.3.0/opensearch-dashboards-1.3.0-test.yml).
   
    1. It supports two test configs - `with-security` and `without-security`, which runs test with security plugin enabled and disabled respectively. Choose one or both depending on what your plugin integration tests support.
   
    2. If your plugin is dependent on `job-scheduler` zip, you can define that in `build-dependencies` in the config. Currently, the test workflow only supports `job-scheduler` as build dependency. Please create an issue if your plugin needs more support.

3. For backward compatibility testing, the `test-workflow` runs backward compatibility tests available in the plugin repository, (see [reference]((https://github.com/opensearch-project/anomaly-detection/blob/d9a122d05282f7efc1e24c61d64f18dec0fd47af/build.gradle#L428))). Like integration test, it has a set of configurable options defined in opensearch-1.3.0-test.yml, [example](manifests/1.3.0/opensearch-1.3.0-test.yml).

    1. It supports two test configs - `with-security` and `without-security`, which runs test with security plugin enabled and disabled respectively. Choose one or both depending on what your plugin integration tests support.
