## Releasing OpenSearch

### Creating a New Version

OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards are distributed as bundles that include both core engines and plugins. Each new OpenSearch release process starts when any one component increments a version, typically on the `main` branch. For example, [OpenSearch#1192](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/pull/1192) incremented the version to 2.0. The [manifest automation workflow](.github/workflows/manifests.yml) will notice this change, and make a pull request (e.g. [opensearch-build#514](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/pull/514)) that adds a new manifest (e.g. [opensearch-2.0.0.yml](manifests/2.0.0/opensearch-2.0.0.yml). After that's merged, a GitHub issue is automatically opened by [this workflow](.github/workflows/releases.yml) to make a new release using [this release template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/release_template.md) (e.g. [opensearch-build#566](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/issues/566)). Existing and new components [(re)onboard into every release](ONBOARDING.md) by submitting pull requests to each version's manifest.

### Building and Testing an OpenSearch Distribution

OpenSearch and its components are built from source, assembled, signed and tested using the [bundle workflow](bundle-workflow/README.md).

### Making a Release

#### Releasing for Linux

The Linux release is managed by a team at Amazon following [this release template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/release_template.md) (e.g. [opensearch-build#566](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/issues/566)).

#### Releasing for FreeBSD

The FreeBSD ports and packages for OpenSearch are managed by a community [OpenSearch Team](https://wiki.freebsd.org/OpenSearch) at FreeBSD.  When a new release is rolled out, this team will update the port and commit it to the FreeBSD ports tree. Anybody is welcome to help the team by providing patches for [upgrading the ports](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/porters-handbook/book/#port-upgrading) following the [FreeBSD Porter's Handbook](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/porters-handbook/book/) instructions.

### Deploying infrastructure

Storage and access roles for the OpenSearch release process are codified in a [CDK project](deployment/README.md).
