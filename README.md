## Releasing OpenSearch

### Creating a New Version

OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards are distributed as bundles that include both core engines and plugins. Each new OpenSearch release process starts when any one component increments a version, typically on the `main` branch. For example, [OpenSearch#1192](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/pull/1192) incremented the version to 2.0. The [automation process in this repo](.github/workflows/manifests.yml) will notice this change and create a new manifest in [manifests](./manifests). A job is then added to start building this new version.  

### Building and Testing an OpenSearch Distribution 

OpenSearch and its components are built from source, assembled, signed and tested using the [bundle workflow](bundle-workflow/README.md).

### Making a Release
