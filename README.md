### Releasing OpenSearch

Please refer to the [release process document](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/wiki/Releasing-the-Distribution) for detailed information on how to release the OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards software.


#### Releases and Versions

The OpenSearch project releases as versioned distributions of OpenSearch, OpenSearch Dashboards, and the OpenSearch plugins. It [follows semantic versioning](https://opensearch.org/blog/technical-post/2021/08/what-is-semver/). Software, such as Data Prepper, clients, and the Logstash output plugin, are versioned independently of the OpenSearch Project. They also may have independent releases from the main project distributions. The OpenSearch Project may also release software under alpha, beta, release candidate, and generally available labels. The definition of when to use these labels is derived from [the Wikipedia page on Software release lifecycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle). Below is the definition of when to use each label.

#### Release labels:

* **Alpha** - The code is released with instructions to build. Built distributions of the software may not be available. Some features many not be complete. Additional testing and development work is planned. Distributions will be postfixed with `-alphaX` where "X" is the number of the alpha version  (e.g., "2.0-alpha1").
* **Beta** - Built distributions of the software are available. All features are completed. Additional testing and development work is planned. Distributions will be postfixed with `-betaX` where "X" is the number of the beta version  (e.g., "2.0.0-beta1").
* **Release Candidate** - Built distributions of the software are available. All features are completed. Code is tested and minimal validation remains. At this stage the software is potentially stable and will release unless significant bugs emerge. Distributions will be postfixed with `-rcX` where "X" is the number of the release candidate version (e.g., "2.0.0-rc1").
* **Generally Available** - Built distributions of the software are available. All features are completed and documented. All testing is completed. Distributions for generally available versions are not postfixed with an additional label (e.g., "2.0.0").


### Onboarding a New Plugin

Plugin owners can follow the [Onboarding Process](ONBOARDING.md) to onboard their plugins to the release process. 

### Building and Testing an OpenSearch Distribution

The distribution workflow builds a complete OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards distribution from source. You can currently build 1.0, 1.1, 1.1-SNAPSHOT and 1.2 versions. This system performs a top-down [build](src/build_workflow) of all components required for a specific OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards release, then [assembles](src/assemble_workflow/) a distribution. The input to the system is a manifest that defines the order in which components should be built. All manifests for our current releases are [here](manifests). 

#### Building from Source

```bash
./build.sh manifests/1.3.0/opensearch-1.3.0.yml 
```

This builds OpenSearch 1.3.0 from source, placing the output into `./builds/opensearch`. 

See [build workflow](src/build_workflow) for more information.

#### Assembling a Distribution 

```bash
./assemble.sh builds/opensearch/manifest.yml
```

The assembling step takes output from the build step, installs plugins, and assembles a full distribution into the `dist` folder. 

See [assemble workflow](src/assemble_workflow) for more information.

#### Building Patches

A patch release contains output from previous versions mixed with new source code. Manifests can mix such references. See [opensearch-1.3.1.yml](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/blob/opensearch-1.3.1/manifests/1.3.1/opensearch-1.3.1.yml) for an example.

OpenSearch is often released with changes in `opensearch-min`, and no changes to plugins other than a version bump. This can be performed by a solo engineer following [a cookbook](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-plugins/blob/main/META.md#increment-a-version-in-every-plugin). See also [opensearch-build#1375](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/issues/1375) which aims to automate incrementing versions for the next development iteration.

#### Min Snapshots

Snapshots for OpenSearch core/min can be downloaded and used in CI's, local development, etc using below links:

Linux:
```
https://artifacts.opensearch.org/snapshots/core/opensearch/<version>-SNAPSHOT/opensearch-min-<version>-SNAPSHOT-linux-x64-latest.tar.gz
```
macOS:
```
https://artifacts.opensearch.org/snapshots/core/opensearch/<version>-SNAPSHOT/opensearch-min-<version>-SNAPSHOT-darwin-x64-latest.tar.gz
```

Windows:
```
https://artifacts.opensearch.org/snapshots/core/opensearch/<version>-SNAPSHOT/opensearch-min-<version>-SNAPSHOT-windows-x64-latest.zip
```

#### CI/CD Environment

We build, assemble, and test our artifacts on docker containers. We provide docker files in [docker/ci](docker/ci) folder, and images on [staging docker hub repositories](https://hub.docker.com/r/opensearchstaging/ci-runner/). All Jenkins pipelines can be found in [jenkins](./jenkins/). Jenkins itself is in the process of being made public and its CDK open-sourced.

See [jenkins](./jenkins) and [docker](./docker) for more information.

#### Build Numbers

The distribution URL and the build output manifest include a Jenkins auto-incremented build number. For example, the [manifest](https://ci.opensearch.org/ci/dbc/distribution-build-opensearch/2.2.0/5905/linux/x64/rpm/dist/opensearch/manifest.yml) from [OpenSearch build 5905](https://build.ci.opensearch.org/job/distribution-build-opensearch/5905/) contains the following.

```yml
build:
  name: OpenSearch
  version: 2.2.0
  platform: linux
  architecture: x64
  distribution: rpm
  id: '5905'
```

#### Latest Distribution URL

Use the `latest` keyword in the URL to obtain the latest build for a given version. For example `https://ci.opensearch.org/ci/dbc/distribution-build-opensearch/2.2.0/latest/linux/x64/rpm/dist/opensearch/manifest.yml` redirects to [build 5905](https://ci.opensearch.org/ci/dbc/distribution-build-opensearch/2.2.0/5905/linux/x64/rpm/dist/opensearch/manifest.yml) at the time of writing this.

The `latest` keyword is resolved to a specific build number by checking the `index.json` [file](https://ci.opensearch.org/ci/dbc/distribution-build-opensearch/2.2.0/index.json). This file has contents such as this.

```
{"latest":"5905"}
```

The file is updated when a distribution build job is completed for the given product and version (or is created when such distribution job succeeds for the first time). Since one distribution build job consists of multiple stages for different combinations of distribution type, platform and architecture, the `index.json` is only modified once all stages succeed. With this said, the `latest` URL only works when the distribution build job succeeds at least once for the given product and version.

The resolution logic is implemented in the [CloudFront URL rewriter](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-ci/tree/main/resources/cf-url-rewriter). 
The TTL (time to live) is set to `5 mins` which means that the `latest` URL may need up to 5 mins to get new contents after `index.json` is updated.

All the artifacts accessible through the regular distribution URL can be accessed by the `latest` URL. This includes both OpenSearch Core, OpenSearch Dashboards Core and their plugins. 

For example, you can download the latest .tar.gz distribution build of OpenSearch 2.2.0 directly at `https://ci.opensearch.org/ci/dbc/distribution-build-opensearch/2.2.0/latest/linux/x64/tar/dist/opensearch/opensearch-2.2.0-linux-x64.tar.gz`, without having to first download and parse the [complete build manifest](https://ci.opensearch.org/ci/dbc/distribution-build-opensearch/2.2.0/latest/linux/x64/tar/dist/opensearch/manifest.yml).

For plugin artifacts, you can also use the `latest` keyword to get the latest plugin artifacts with a known version. E.g. in order to get performance-analyzer x64 tarball artifacts for 2.1.0, you can obtain it with link `https://ci.opensearch.org/ci/dbc/distribution-build-opensearch/2.1.0/latest/linux/x64/tar/builds/opensearch/plugins/opensearch-performance-analyzer-2.1.0.0.zip`, which will redirect you to `https://ci.opensearch.org/ci/dbc/distribution-build-opensearch/2.1.0/5757/linux/x64/tar/builds/opensearch/plugins/opensearch-performance-analyzer-2.1.0.0.zip`.

For bundled artifacts, here are some examples for LINUX and Windows:
* Linux Tar: `https://ci.opensearch.org/ci/dbc/distribution-build-opensearch/2.4.0/latest/linux/x64/tar/dist/opensearch/opensearch-2.4.0-linux-x64.tar.gz`
* Windows Zip: `https://ci.opensearch.org/ci/dbc/distribution-build-opensearch/2.4.0/latest/windows/x64/zip/dist/opensearch/opensearch-2.4.0-windows-x64.zip`

#### Testing the Distribution

Tests the OpenSearch distribution, including integration, backwards-compatibility and performance tests.

```bash
./test.sh <test-type> <test-manifest-path> <path>
```

See [src/test_workflow](./src/test_workflow) for more information.

#### Checking Release Notes

Workflow to check if the release notes exist or not and shows the latest commit for OpenSearch and Dashboard distributions.

To run:
```bash
./release_notes.sh check manifests/2.2.0/opensearch-2.2.0.yml --date 2022-07-26
```

See [src/release_notes_workflow](./src/release_notes_workflow) for more information.
#### Signing Artifacts

For all types of signing within OpenSearch project we use `opensearch-signer-client` (in progress of being open-sourced) which is a wrapper around internal signing system and is only available for authenticated users. The input requires a path to the build manifest or directory containing all the artifacts or a single artifact. 

Usage:

```bash
./sign.sh builds/opensearch/manifest.yml
```

The tool currently supports following platforms for signing.

##### PGP

Anything can be signed using PGP signing eg: tarball, any type of file, etc. A `.sig` file will be returned containing the signature. OpenSearch and OpenSearch dashboards distributions, components such as data prepper, etc. as well as maven artifacts are signed using PGP signing. See [this page](https://opensearch.org/verify-signatures.html) for how to verify signatures.


##### Windows

Windows signing can be used to sign windows executables such as `.msi, .msp, .msm, .cab, .dll, .exe, .appx, .appxbundle, .msix, .msixbundle, .sys, .vxd, .ps1, .psm1`, and any PE file that is supported by [Signtool.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/signtool-exe). Various windows artifacts such as SQL OBDC, opensearch-cli, etc are signed using this method. 
Windows code signing uses EV (Extended Validated) code signing certificates.

|  Types of signing/Details   | Digest           | Cipher  | Key Size|
| ------------- |:-------------| :-----| :-----|
| PGP      | SHA1 | AES-128 | 2048 |
| Windows      | SHA256      |    RSA | |
| RPM | SHA512      |    RSA | 4096 |


#### Signing RPM artifacts

RPM artifacts are signed via a legacy shell script which uses a [macros template](scripts/pkg/sign_templates/rpmmacros). See [this commit](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/commit/950d55c1ed3f82e98120541fa40ff506338c1059) for more information and [this issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/issues/1547) to add RPM artifact signing functionality to the above signing system. Currently we are only signing OpenSearch and OpenSearch dashboards RPM distributions using this method.

See [src/sign_workflow](./src/sign_workflow) for more information.


### Making a Release

#### Releasing for Linux and Windows

The Linux / Windows release is managed by a team at Amazon following [this release template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/release_template.md) (e.g. [opensearch-build#2649](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/issues/2649)).

#### Releasing for FreeBSD

The FreeBSD ports and packages for OpenSearch are managed by a community [OpenSearch Team](https://wiki.freebsd.org/OpenSearch) at FreeBSD.  When a new release is rolled out, this team will update the port and commit it to the FreeBSD ports tree. Anybody is welcome to help the team by providing patches for [upgrading the ports](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/porters-handbook/book/#port-upgrading) following the [FreeBSD Porter's Handbook](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/porters-handbook/book/) instructions.

#### Releasing for macOS

At this moment there's no official macOS distribution. However, this project does support building and assembling OpenSearch for macOS. See [opensearch-build#37](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/issues/37) and [#38](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/issues/38) for more details.

### Utilities

#### Checking Out Source

The [checkout workflow](src/checkout_workflow) checks out source code for a given manifest for further examination.

```bash
./checkout.sh manifests/1.3.0/opensearch-1.3.0.yml
```

See [src/checkout_workflow](./src/checkout_workflow) for more information.

#### Cross-Platform Builds

You can perform cross-platform builds. For example, build and assemble a Windows distribution on macOS.

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home) # required by OpenSearch install-plugin during assemble
./build.sh manifests/1.3.0/opensearch-1.3.0.yml --snapshot --platform windows
./assemble.sh builds/opensearch/manifest.yml
```

This will produce `dist/opensearch-1.3.0-SNAPSHOT-windows-x64.zip` on Linux and macOS.

#### Sanity Checking the Bundle

This workflow runs sanity checks on every component present in the bundle, executed as part of the [manifests workflow](.github/workflows/manifests.yml) in this repository. It ensures that the component GitHub repositories are correct and versions in those components match the OpenSearch version.

The following example sanity-checks components in the OpenSearch 1.3.0 manifest.

```bash
./ci.sh manifests/1.3.0/opensearch-1.3.0.yml --snapshot
```

See [src/ci_workflow](./src/ci_workflow) for more information.

#### Auto-Generating Manifests

The [manifests workflow](src/manifests_workflow) reacts to version increments in OpenSearch and its components by extracting Gradle properties from project branches. When a new version is found, a new input manifest is added to [manifests](manifests), and [a pull request is opened](.github/workflows/manifests.yml) (e.g. [opensearch-build#491](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/pull/491)).

Show information about existing manifests. 

```bash
./manifests.sh list
```
Check for updates and create any new manifests. 

```bash
./manifests.sh update
```

See [src/manifests_workflow](./src/manifests_workflow) for more information.


### Deploying Infrastructure

This project uses jenkins as the build infrastructure for building, testing and releasing the artifacts. The infrastructure is deployed using CDK and code can be found in [opensearch-ci](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-ci/tree/main) repository.
