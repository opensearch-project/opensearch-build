## OpenSearch Bundle Workflow

This workflow builds a complete OpenSearch bundle from source. You can currently build 1.0, 1.1 and 1.1-SNAPSHOT.

### Build from Source

Each build requires a manifest to be passed as input.  We currently have the following input manifests:

| name        | description                                                                         |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [opensearch-1.0.0.yml](/manifests/opensearch-1.0.0.yml) |  Manifest to reproduce 1.0.0 build.                 |
| [opensearch-1.0.0-maven.yml](/manifests/opensearch-1.0.0-maven.yml)|   One-time manifest to build and push maven artifacts for 1.0 from tags. Going forward a separate maven manifest is not required. For 1.0.0 we do not have solid 1.0 refs for all repos nor do we need to rebuild the full bundle.|
| [opensearch-1.1.0.yml](/manifests/opensearch-1.1.0.yml)| Manifest to build upcoming 1.x release.


Usage:

```bash
./bundle-workflow/build.sh manifests/opensearch-1.1.0.yml --snapshot
```

The [OpenSearch repo](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch) is built first, followed by [common-utils](https://github.com/opensearch-project/common-utils), and all declared plugin repositories. These dependencies are published to maven local under `~/.m2`, and subsequent project builds pick those up. All final output is placed into an `artifacts` folder along with a build output `manifest.yml` that contains output details.

Artifacts will contain the following folders.

```
/artifacts
  bundle/ <- contains opensearch min tarball 
  maven/ <- all built maven artifacts
  plugins/ <- all built plugin zips
  core-plugins/ <- all built core plugins zip
  manifest.yml <- build manifest describing all built components and their artifacts
```

The following options are available in `bundle-workflow/build.sh`.

| name               | description                                                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| --snapshot         | Build a snapshot instead of a release artifact, default is `false`.     |
| --component [name] | Rebuild a single component by name, e.g. `--component common-utils`.    |
| --keep             | Do not delete the temporary working directory on both success or error. |
| -v, --verbose      | Show more verbose output.                                               |

#### Custom Build Scripts

Each component build relies on a `build.sh` script that is used to prepare bundle artifacts for a particular bundle version that takes two arguments: version and target architecture. By default the tool will look for a script in [scripts/components](scripts/components), then in the checked-out repository in `build/build.sh`, then default to a Gradle build implemented in [scripts/default/build.sh](scripts/default/build.sh).

### Assemble the Bundle 

```bash
./bundle-workflow/assemble.sh artifacts/manifest.yml
```

The bundling step takes output from the build step, installs plugins, and assembles a full bundle into a `bundle` folder. The input requires a path to the build manifest and is expected to be inside the `artifacts` directory that contains `bundle`, `maven`, `plugins` and `core-plugins` subdirectories from the build step.

Artifacts will be updated as follows.

```
/bundle
  <file-name>.tar.gz <- assembled tarball
  manifest.yml <- bundle manifest describing versions for the min bundle and all installed plugins and their locations
```

#### Custom Install Scripts

You can perform additional plugin install steps by adding an `install.sh` script. By default the tool will look for a script in [scripts/bundle-build/components](scripts/bundle-build/components), then default to a noop version implemented in [scripts/default/install.sh](scripts/default/install.sh).

### Signing Artifacts

The signing step (optional) takes the manifest file created from the build step and signs all its component artifacts using the opensearch-signer-client. The input requires a path to the build manifest and is expected to be inside the artifacts directory with the same directories mentioned in the build step. 

The following options are available. 

| name          | description                                                                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| --component   | The component name of the component whose artifacts will be signed                  |
| --type        | The artifact type to be signed. Currently one of 3 options: [plugins, maven, bundle]|
| -v, --verbose | Show more verbose output.                                                           |

The signed artifacts (<artifact>.asc) will be found in the same location as the original artifact. 

Signing step (to sign all artifacts):
```bash
./bundle_workflow/sign.sh artifacts/manifest.yml
```

### Test the Bundle

Tests the OpenSearch bundle.

This workflow contains two sections: Integration Tests, Backwards Compatibility Tests.

#### Integration Tests

This step runs integration tests invoking `integtest.sh` in each component from bundle manifest.

#### Backwards Compatibility Tests

This step run backward compatibility invoking `bwctest.sh` in each component from bundle manifest.

Usage:

Kick off all test suites on a manifest:
```bash
./bundle-workflow/test.sh manifests/opensearch-1.0.0.yml
```

The following options are available.

| name               | description                                                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| --component [name] | Test a single component by name, e.g. `--component common-utils`.       |
| --keep             | Do not delete the temporary working directory on both success or error. |
| -v, --verbose      | Show more verbose output.                                               |

### Sanity Check the Bundle

Runs basic sanity checks on the OpenSearch bundle.

This workflow runs basic sanity checks on every component present in the bundle. For starters, it ensures that the component GitHub repositories are correct.

Usage:

```bash
./bundle-workflow/ci.sh manifests/opensearch-1.1.0.yml
```

The following options are available.

| name               | description                                                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| --component [name] | Test a single component by name, e.g. `--component common-utils`.       |
| --keep             | Do not delete the temporary working directory on both success or error. |
| -v, --verbose      | Show more verbose output.                                               |
