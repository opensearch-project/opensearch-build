# OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards 2.9.0 Release Notes

## Release Highlights
OpenSearch 2.9.0 includes a range of new features and enhancements to support search, analytics, observability, and security workloads, along with new codecs that offer performance improvements and increased index compression. A new experimental SDK lets you build your own extensions for OpenSearch.

### New Features
* Search pipelines functionality is now generally available. Now, you can configure processors to transform search requests and responses and integrate functions like query rewriters and results rerankers.
* The neural search plugin is now generally available. These tools can help you build applications like semantic search more easily and take advantage of OpenSearch’s vector database capabilities.
* The machine learning (ML) framework is generally available in this release. This makes it easier to operationalize and integrate ML models by enabling users to upload their own models to OpenSearch.
* You can now integrate externally managed ML models with OpenSearch using new connectors. Connectors to external models can be created by defining a blueprint in JSON.
* Vector database functionality is enhanced with pre-filtering for queries using the Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) engine, enabling the use of metadata to filter queries prior to performing nearest neighbors searches on k-NN indexes.
* Support for Lucene byte-sized vectors allows the use of vectors that have been quantized to the size of one byte per dimension instead of four for reduced storage and memory requirements.
* You can now view alerts and anomalies directly overlaid with the primary dashboards you use to monitor your environments and create alerting monitors or anomaly detectors directly from OpenSearch Dashboards.
* New composite monitors allow users to chain alerts generated by multiple individual monitors into a single workflow, enabling users to analyze data sources based on multiple criteria, create targeted notifications, and reduce alert volume.
* A new index compression codec enables performance improvements and reduced index sizes. The new codecs, zstd and zstd_no_dict, use the Zstandard compression algorithm for balanced compression and performance. 
* Security Analytics supports a new ingestion schema for log data that follows the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF). A new correlation engine lets you create custom correlation rules to produce findings across different log sources.
* Geospatial tools add support for three types of aggregations using geoshapes data: geo_bounds, geo_hash, and geo_tile.
* CAT shards and CAT indices are added to the cluster health monitor metrics, allowing you to monitor the state of all primary and replica shards along with information related to index health and resource usage to support operational uptime.


### Experimental Features

OpenSearch 2.9.0 release introduces an experimental SDK that gives developers the tools to build extensions for OpenSearch. The SDK provides interfaces for communicating with OpenSearch, allows extensions to be decoupled from OpenSearch versions, and other changes designed to make it easier for developers to build, and users to deploy, extensions of OpenSearch’s functionality.


## Release Details

[OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards 2.9.0](https://opensearch.org/versions/opensearch-2-9-0.html) includes the following feature, enhancement, bug fixes, infrastructure, documentation, maintenance and refactoring updates.
