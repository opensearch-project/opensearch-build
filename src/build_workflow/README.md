## Building from Source

The build workflow builds components declared in an input manifest from source, or downloads previously built artifacts, in order. All manifests for current releases are in [manifests](../../manifests). Here are some examples.

| name                                                                                 | description                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [opensearch-1.0.0.yml](/manifests/1.0.0/opensearch-1.0.0.yml)                        | Manifest to reproduce 1.0.0 build.                             |
| [opensearch-1.0.0-maven.yml](/manifests/1.0.0/opensearch-1.0.0-maven.yml)            | One-time manifest to build maven artifacts for 1.0 from tags.  |
| [opensearch-1.1.0.yml](/manifests/1.1.0/opensearch-1.1.0.yml)                        | Manifest for 1.1.0, the current version.                       |
| [opensearch-1.1.1.yml](/manifests/1.1.1/opensearch-1.1.1.yml)                        | Manifest for 1.1.1, a patch release.                           |
| [opensearch-1.2.0.yml](/manifests/1.2.0/opensearch-1.2.0.yml)                        | Manifest for 1.2.0, the next version.                          |
| [opensearch-2.0.0.yml](/manifests/2.0.0/opensearch-2.0.0.yml)                        | Manifest for 2.0.0, the next major version of OpenSearch.      |
| [opensearch-dashboards-1.1.0.yml](/manifests/1.1.0/opensearch-dashboards-1.1.0.yml)  | Manifest for 1.1.0, the next version of OpenSearch Dashboards. |    

The following example builds a snapshot version of OpenSearch 1.2.0.

```bash
./build.sh manifests/1.2.0/opensearch-1.2.0.yml --snapshot
```

While the following builds a snapshot version of OpenSearch-Dashboards 1.2.0.

```bash
./build.sh manifests/1.2.0/opensearch-dashboards-1.2.0.yml --snapshot
```

The [OpenSearch repo](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch) is built first, followed by [common-utils](https://github.com/opensearch-project/common-utils), and all declared plugin repositories. These dependencies are published to maven local under `~/.m2`, and subsequent project builds pick those up. 

The [OpenSearch Dashboards repo](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards) is built first, followed by all declared plugin repositories. 

All final output is placed into a `builds/opensearch` and `builds/opensearch-dashboards` folder respectively, along with a build output `manifest.yml` that contains output details.

#### OpenSearch

The build order first publishes `OpenSearch` followed by `common-utils`, and publishes these artifacts to maven local so that they are available for each component. In order to ensure that the same versions are used, a `-Dopensearch.version` flag is provided to each component's build script that defines which version the component should build against.

#### OpenSearch Dashboards

The build order first pulls down `OpenSearch-Dashboards` and then utilizes it to build other components. Currently, building plugins requires having the core repository built first to bootstrap and build the modules utilized by plugins.

### Build Paths

To build components we rely on a common entry-point in the form of a `build.sh` script. Within each build script components have the option to place artifacts in a set of directories to be picked up and published on their behalf. These are as follows.

| name               | description                                                                                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /dist              | Include any distributions, e.g. opensearch or opensearch-dashboards min tarball.                        |
| /maven             | Include any publications that should be pushed to maven                                                 |
| /plugins           | Where a plugin zip should be placed. If included it will be installed during bundle assembly.           |
| /core-plugins      | Where plugins shipped from `https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch` should be placed          |
| /bundle            | Where the min bundle should be placed when built from `https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch`|
| /libs              | Where any additional libs should be placed that are required during bundle assembly                     |

### Build.sh Options

The following options are available in `build.sh`.

| name                    | description                                                                            |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -s, --snapshot          | Build a snapshot instead of a release artifact, default is `false`.                    |
| -a, --architecture      | Specify architecture to build, default is architecture of build system.                |
| -d, --distribution      | Specify distribution to build, default is `tar`.                                       |
| -p, --platform          | Specify platform to build, default is platform of build system.                        |
| --component [name ...]  | Rebuild a subset of components by name, e.g. `--component common-utils job-scheduler`. |
| --keep                  | Do not delete the temporary working directory on both success or error.                |
| --continue-on-error     | Do not fail the bundle build on plugin component failure.                              |
| -l, --lock              | Generate a stable reference manifest.                                                  |
| -v, --verbose           | Show more verbose output.                                                              |

### Custom Build Scripts

Each component build relies on a `build.sh` script that is used to prepare bundle artifacts for a particular bundle version that takes two arguments: version and target architecture. By default the tool will look for a script in [scripts/components](../../scripts/components), then in the checked-out repository in `scripts/build.sh`, then default to a Gradle build implemented in [scripts/default/opensearch/build.sh](../../scripts/default/opensearch/build.sh).

### Avoiding Rebuilds

Builds can automatically generate a `manifest.lock` file with stable git references (commit IDs) and build options (platform, architecture and snapshot) by specifying `--lock`. The output can then be reused as input manifest after checking against a collection of prior builds.

```bash
MANIFEST=manifests/1.2.0/opensearch-1.2.0.yml
SHAS=shas

./build.sh --lock $MANIFEST # generates opensearch-1.2.0.yml.lock

MANIFEST_SHA=$(sha1sum $MANIFEST.lock | cut -f1 -d' ') # generate a checksum of the stable manifest

if test -f "$SHAS/$MANIFEST_SHA.lock"; then
  echo "Skipping $MANIFEST_SHA"
else
  ./build.sh $MANIFEST.lock # rebuild using stable references in .lock
  mkdir -p $SHAS
  cp $MANIFEST.lock $SHAS/$MANIFEST_SHA.lock # save the stable reference manifest
fi
```

The [Jenkins workflows](../../jenkins) in this repository can use this mechanism to avoid rebuilding all of OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards unnecessarily. 

### Incremental Build

This functionality augments the existing build process by introducing the `--incremental` binary parameter.

Sample command: `./build.sh manifests/2.12.0/opensearch-2.12.0.yml --incremental`.

The build workflow will examine the build manifest from the previous build using path `{distribution}/builds/opensearch/manifest.yml` when this command is executed.
The build workflow will be executed in accordance with the comparison between the commits for each component in the preceding build manifest and the current input manifest.
It will contain every modified component, and every component that relies on these revised components based on the `depends_on` entry in the input manifest.

Once build is finished, new built artifacts will override the previous artifacts and a new build manifest will be generated using the previous build manifest as a reference, ensuring that all non-modified components remain unchanged.
